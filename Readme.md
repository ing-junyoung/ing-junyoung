HiðŸ‘‹, I am interested in modeling and optimization of machine learning and deep learning.<br>
And, I want to find meaning that can't be seen with the naked eye from the data and actually service it. <br>
So, Iâ€™m currently majoring in data science and in a master's course.<br>

ðŸ“£ This place will share what I personally studied and the projects I worked on.
Thank you :D
